<h2>You are here and why should you care?</h2>
<div class="rows">
<div class="col-md-8">
<p>Maybe you are a student, a professor, corporate worker or a person with any skill - you can earn some extra 
cash anytime. You can be a freelancer. A freelancer or freelance worker is a term commonly used for a person 
who is self-employed and is not necessarily committed to a particular employer long-term. 55 million 
Americans--35% of the workforce--have freelance careers, with a combined estimated 
earning of $1 trillion a year. </p>

<p>Imagine you are a student and you can write very well and you are in need of some extra cash. Why not earn 
it? You can freelance for someone who is in need of some article or blog. That's it. So let's explore 
the freelancing world. </p>

<h2>Let's Explore</h2>
<p>A freelancer is self-employed person offering services, usually to businesses and often to multiple clients at a time. The type of work freelancers do varies. 
Nearly every type of service a business would need could be provided by a freelancer, including (but not limited to), marketing, such as social media 
marketing, copywriting, and publicity, writing, such as articles and blog posts, technological support, such as web programming and design, creative 
works such as graphic design, and financial support, 
such as bookkeeping.</p><br>
<p>Freelancing is so flexible, you can set your own hours, working full or part-time on the projects of your choice. While clients can offer 
specifications to the work, a freelancer works similar to an independent contractor, in which he's free to control how the work is 
completed. This is an important distinction for tax purposes, because the IRS views employees and independent contractors 
differently.</p>

<h3>Advantages of Freelancing</h3>
<p><ul>
<li>Get started quickly...today even. As long as you already know the skill you plan to offer, getting started is 
simply a matter of finding your first client.
<li>Easy to start. You can start right now, using your network find a client. While you'll want to build a 
LinkedIn profile and/or a website, you can network within your current career and friend networks to find 
your first client.
<li>Affordable. Odds are if you have the ability to provide the service, you also have whatever equipment 
or software you need to deliver it. Eventually you'll want to invest in business building tools, such as a 
website, but using LinkedIn (which is free) is a great online resume that can help you promote your 
service.
<li>High demand for help. While the marketplace of freelancers is competitive, the need for quality, 
reliable freelancers is growing. Many businesses don't have employees and instead have 
a team of freelancers.
<li>Choose your own schedule. Work when and where you want.
</ul>

<h3>How to Get Started as a Freelancer</h3>
<p>Getting started as a freelancer is as easy as visiting one of the 
freelance sites to find work, and networking with your current sphere of 
influence to find your first client. Here's steps to building a 
freelance career:</p>
<p><ol>
<li>Decide what you'll offer. Common freelance work includes writing, 
web design, graphic design, photography, marketing, social media 
management, bookkeeping and more.
<li>Determine your target market. Who needs what you have to offer? Decide if you'll specialize within a specific niche of your service (i.e. copy writing or WordPress web design) or within a specific market (i.e. writing for Realtors or web design for authors). This is the time to decide your brand and unique selling proposition.
<li>Create an online portfolio. Start at LinkedIn, a social network all about career networking. Build a profile that promotes the benefits you have to offer. Consider setting up a website, which will offer you more customization and flexibility than LinkedIn. 
<li>Set your prices. Make sure you charge enough to cover your overhead, time to do the work, as well as to earn a living.
<li>Start reaching out to find clients. Use your network to help you connect with potential clients. Consider using a freelance site, such as <b><u>Freelancer.com</b></u> or <b><u>Upwork (formally eLance and Odesk)</b></u> to find work. While they may pay less than you want, it can be a great way to get experience, testimonials and referrals

Which suggests you can both travel and work! That sounds interesting ain't it? So what are you waiting for?
